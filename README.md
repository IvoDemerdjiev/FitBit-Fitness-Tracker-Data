FitBit Fitness Tracker Data Analysis
This repository contains Python code for analyzing FitBit fitness tracker data. FitBit is a popular wearable device for tracking various aspects of physical activity and health. This analysis focuses on several data sets, including daily activity, sleep patterns, heart rate, weight logs, and more.

Data Exploration
The analysis begins by reading and exploring the provided data sets. Data from various CSV files, including daily activity, hourly data, and sleep records, are loaded into pandas DataFrames. The number of unique users in each data set is calculated, providing insights into the size and coverage of the data.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the data for analysis. Missing values are checked for, and data types are converted as needed. The analysis also includes labeling days of the week and identifying weekends, which can be useful for understanding activity patterns.

Data Analysis
The analysis delves into the FitBit data, providing statistics and insights. Descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, and percentiles, are computed for metrics like daily steps, distances, and activity minutes. Additionally, there is an exploration of users with zero steps recorded and a breakdown of their activity patterns.

Data Visualization
Visualizations are included to help convey the findings more effectively. Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to create various plots and charts, providing a visual representation of the data.

Conclusions
The analysis offers valuable insights into FitBit data, highlighting user activity patterns, trends, and potential areas for further investigation. This repository serves as a starting point for anyone interested in exploring FitBit fitness tracker data and deriving actionable insights from it.
